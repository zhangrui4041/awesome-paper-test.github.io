                In the era of relentless technological advancements and the ever-increasing availability of digital information, digital libraries have emerged as pivotal resources for the global dissemination of knowledge. Particularly in the field of computer science, where the rate of content generation is exponential, these libraries face the demanding task of archiving, managing, and enabling access to comprehensive collections of academic work. Historically, digital libraries focused primarily on digital preservation and basic search functionalities. However, with users seeking more personalized and relevant content delivery, there is a pressing need to evolve these libraries beyond their conventional roles.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize digital library systems by introducing bespoke and intuitive user experiences. AI algorithms can process vast datasets to understand patterns, preferences, and behaviors, enabling personalized information retrieval. As users increasingly engage with digital platforms that adapt to their unique preferences, the demand for similar capabilities in digital libraries has grown substantially. The infusion of AI in these systems can offer predictive insights, enhanced search accuracy, and meaningful content recommendations, fundamentally transforming user interactions with digital libraries into more dynamic and learner-centric experiences.

This paper explores the theoretical and practical implications of infusing AI technologies within digital library environments. We analyze current AI applications, such as recommendation systems and intelligent search algorithms, emphasizing their effectiveness in curating personalized learning journeys. Additionally, we discuss the ethical considerations and logistical challenges associated with AI integration in digital libraries. By juxtaposing traditional library services with contemporary AI-driven solutions, this study provides a comprehensive examination of how personalized digital libraries can redefine accessibility and engagement in the computer science domain.

As the digital ecosystem continues to expand, the opportunity to leverage AI for the enrichment of digital libraries is both timely and essential. Our investigation aims to offer a strategic pathway for stakeholders interested in transforming digital library infrastructures, thereby aligning library services with the evolving expectations and requirements of modern-day users and researchers. Through an in-depth evaluation of case studies and emerging technologies, the paper advocates for a systematic approach to incorporating AI, ensuring that digital libraries not only preserve knowledge but also proactively contribute to educational advancement and scholarly interaction.
