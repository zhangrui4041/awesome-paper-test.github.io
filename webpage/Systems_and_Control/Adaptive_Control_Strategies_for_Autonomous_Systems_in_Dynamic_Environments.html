                This paper explores novel adaptive control strategies designed for autonomous systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. As autonomous agents increasingly integrate into sectors such as transportation, logistics, and healthcare, their ability to navigate these environments safely and efficiently is paramount. We propose a hybrid control framework that combines model predictive control (MPC) with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. This approach allows the system to anticipate future states and adapt in real-time to unpredictable changes. We provide detailed simulations across various scenarios, demonstrating the efficacy of our model in terms of robustness, adaptability, and performance optimization compared to traditional control methods. Our results suggest significant improvements in system responsiveness and decision-making accuracy, paving the way for more reliable autonomous technology deployment.

                Recent advancements in autonomous systems have fundamentally transformed numerous industries, marking a shift towards more intelligent, efficient, and independent operations. These systems, which include autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, must operate in environments characterized by continuous change and uncertainty. The inherent complexity and unpredictability of such environments pose significant challenges for traditional control strategies, which are often static and unable to adapt in real-time.

In response to these challenges, the field of adaptive control has seen growing interest, aiming to endow systems with the capability to learn and adjust their behavior dynamically. This paper addresses the critical need for adaptive control mechanisms by introducing a hybrid framework that synergizes the predictive capabilities of Model Predictive Control (MPC) with the adaptability of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Model Predictive Control is renowned for its ability to forecast future states of a system through optimization over a finite time horizon, thus providing anticipatory control actions. However, MPC relies heavily on accurate modeling of the environment, which may not always be feasible. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning, with its trial-and-error learning paradigm, offers a promising solution by enabling systems to develop policies based on experiences, rather than precise models. Despite RL’s potential, integrating it effectively with control systems to ensure stability and efficiency remains a non-trivial task.

This research undertakes the integration of MPC and RL to form a coherent adaptive control strategy suitable for real-time application in dynamic settings. By leveraging MPC’s planning capabilities and the adaptive learning nature of RL, our proposed framework seeks to optimize the performance of autonomous systems, even in the face of disruptions and unforeseen scenarios.

Through extensive simulations and performance evaluations, this paper demonstrates the significant advantages of the hybrid strategy over traditional methods. These include enhanced system resilience, improved path planning, and decision-making accuracy, which are crucial for advancing autonomous technology in increasingly complex environments. Ultimately, the integration of such adaptive control strategies is poised to not only expand the operational capabilities of autonomous systems but also bolster their acceptance and reliability in real-world applications.
