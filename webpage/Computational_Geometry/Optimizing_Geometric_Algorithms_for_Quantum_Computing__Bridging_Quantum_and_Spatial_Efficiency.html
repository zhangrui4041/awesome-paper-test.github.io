                This paper explores the integration of computational geometry with quantum computing to enhance the efficiency of geometric algorithms. As quantum computing emerges as a frontier technology, its potential to solve complex problems in polynomial time that are classically infeasible is promising, particularly in the realm of spatial computations. Our research investigates the adaptation of traditional geometric algorithms for quantum architectures, focusing on algorithmic speed-up and spatial efficiency. We present a series of modified quantum algorithms for common geometric problems such as convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and Delaunay triangulations. By leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, these algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in computational complexity compared to their classical counterparts. We also address the implementation challenges on current quantum hardware, providing a pathway towards practical applicability as quantum technology advances. This paper aims to bridge a crucial gap in computational geometry, paving the way for innovative solutions and establishing a foundation for future research in quantum-geometric algorithm design.

                Computational geometry plays an essential role in computer science, dealing with the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures to solve geometric problems. In recent years, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly with advancements in areas like robotics, computer graphics, geographical information systems (GIS), and computer-aided design. With the advent of quantum computing, a new paradigm is emerging that holds the potential to revolutionize computations by exploiting quantum mechanics principles to perform operations more efficiently than classical computers. This paper discusses the intriguing intersection of computational geometry and quantum computing, an area ripe for exploration and innovation.

Quantum computing, with its inherent capabilities to perform massive parallel computations, poses the potential to fundamentally alter the efficiency of algorithmic solutions. Characteristics such as superposition and entanglement allow quantum algorithms to express and solve problems in ways unattainable to classical algorithms. In computational geometry, where complex spatial problems often need to be resolved efficiently, quantum computing offers a pathway to explore new algorithmic efficiencies. Traditional problems, such as computing convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and Delaunay triangulations, involve substantial computational effort, especially as dimensionalities increase. The potential to reduce this computational burden through quantum-enhanced algorithms is both enticing and necessary.

The primary motivation for this study is to explore how computational geometry can benefit from the paradigm shift towards quantum computation. Past research has predominantly focused on purely theoretical aspects of quantum algorithms. Our approach is to tailor these algorithms within a geometric context to not only accomplish theoretical improvements but also address practical considerations for implementation on existing quantum platforms. As quantum technology evolves from theoretical constructs to functional hardware, understanding how to map complex geometric problems onto quantum frameworks becomes imperative.

This paper seeks to establish foundational principles for future studies, presenting modified quantum geometric algorithms that show potential performance enhancements over classical strategies. Moreover, by mitigating known challenges of quantum de-coherence and limited qubit connectivity, our study provides strategic insights into the adaptability of geometric algorithms for today's quantum processors. Ultimately, by synergizing advances in computational geometry and quantum computing, this research endeavors to spark continued investigation into innovative, efficient, and scalable solutions for complex spatial problems, delivering impactful benefits across computational domains.
