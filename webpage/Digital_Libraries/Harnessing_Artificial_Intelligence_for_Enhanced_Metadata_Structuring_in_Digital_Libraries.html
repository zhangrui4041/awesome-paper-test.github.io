                The rapid expansion of digital libraries necessitates efficient metadata structuring to manage and retrieve vast amounts of scholarly data effectively. This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP), to improve metadata organization within digital libraries of computer science. By integrating AI-driven methods, we aim to enhance metadata accuracy, consistency, and retrieval speed, which are pivotal for user satisfaction and research efficiency. We present a case study involving AI enhancements in a prominent digital library, illustrating improvements in metadata management. The study concludes with a benchmark comparison highlighting significant gains in retrieval efficiency and user engagement. This research underlines the potential of AI not only in enhancing technical library management but also in ensuring richer user experiences.

                Digital libraries in computer science are an essential cornerstone of modern research, providing scholars with instant access to a vast array of academic resources, journals, and conference papers. As these repositories of knowledge expand with exponential growth in data, the challenges in managing and organizing metadata effectively become increasingly complex. Metadata, essentially the data about data, is critical for searchability and discoverability within these digital libraries. However, traditional methods of metadata entry and organization may fall short given the high volume and rapid spread of new research publications.

With the evolution of AI and machine learning, new opportunities have emerged to tackle these metadata challenges. AI offers promising capabilities in processing large volumes of unstructured data, auto-tagging, and ensuring consistency across varied document formats. Natural Language Processing (NLP), in particular, shows potential in understanding and categorizing content in contextually meaningful ways, thus enhancing the precision and speed of information retrieval.

This paper delves into the role of AI in optimizing metadata structuring for digital libraries, focusing on intelligent algorithms that can automate and refine metadata tasks. The literature suggests significant advantages of AI interventions in other domains, but its application in metadata enhancements for digital libraries remains underexplored. Our work contributes to filling this gap by presenting empirical findings from a case study where AI techniques have been applied to a renowned digital library. In doing so, we aim to demonstrate the transformative impact of AI on library metadata management, underscoring improvements in efficiency concerning metadata accuracy and user interaction.

The impetus behind this research stems from the growing demand for smarter digital library solutions that can keep pace with academic publishing's ever-expanding scale and scope. By harnessing AI, digital libraries can not only maintain robust and efficient systems but also provide enriched user experiences, ultimately fostering a more effective academic ecosystem.
