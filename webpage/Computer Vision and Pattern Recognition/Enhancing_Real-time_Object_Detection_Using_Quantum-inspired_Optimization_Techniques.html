                This paper explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques to enhance the performance of real-time object detection systems. With the rapid advancement of computer vision technologies, real-time object detection has become central to numerous applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to surveillance systems. Standard deep learning models, though powerful, often require significant computational resources and time. This paper proposes an innovative approach utilizing quantum-inspired optimization algorithms, specifically targeting the weight tuning and hyperparameter selection in convolutional neural networks. Initial experiments show that our method achieves a remarkable reduction in computational time while maintaining or even improving detection accuracy. These results suggest the potential for quantum computing principles to be applied effectively within classical computational frameworks, paving the way for more efficient and scalable computer vision systems.

                The rapid advancement of computer vision technology has permeated into various sectors, necessitating robust and efficient methods for real-time object detection. Applications such as autonomous driving, robotic perception, and surveillance systems rely heavily on the ability to accurately and swiftly discern objects in dynamically changing environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of these advancements, laying down the groundwork for various models that achieve high accuracy rates.

However, the demand for higher performance, especially in real-time scenarios, imposes strict constraints on computational resources and processing times. Traditional deep learning models, albeit powerful, often face challenges such as significant energy consumption and latency, which limit their scalability and application in resource-constrained environments. It's within this context that the exploration of novel optimization methods becomes not only beneficial but necessary.

Drawing inspiration from the principles of quantum computing, particularly its promise of exponential improvements in processing capabilities, quantum-inspired optimization offers a promising avenue. These algorithms mimic certain aspects of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance solving potential complexities in large-scale optimization problems. Integrating these techniques into the weight tuning and hyperparameter selection processes for CNNs can potentially reduce computational complexity, without compromising on the model's accuracy and efficiency.

This paper builds upon the premise that quantum-inspired optimization can address the computational inefficiencies inherent in current object detection frameworks. By strategically applying these principles, we propose a method that reduces the computational load associated with real-time object detection. Our initial implementation and tests indicate not only a reduced processing time but also an unexpected improvement in detection accuracy, suggesting a new horizon in the intersection of quantum computing theories and practical computer vision applications.

Through this work, we aim to establish a foundation for further exploration in this intersection of domains, promoting more sustainable and scalable solutions. Such developments are not only important for advancing technology but also crucial for meeting the growing demands of a world increasingly reliant on rapid, efficient, and intelligent data processing systems.
